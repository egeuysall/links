## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

1. **Confidential Disclosure**  
   - Do **not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly.  
   - Send a detailed report to **[hello@egeuysal.com](mailto:hello@egeuysal.com)**.  
   - For urgent security concerns, you may contact us directly at **+1 (657) 900-0231**.  

2. **Information to Include**  
   - A clear and detailed description of the vulnerability.  
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.  
   - The potential impact and affected components.  
   - Suggested mitigations or fixes (if available).  

3. **Response Timeline**  
   - **Acknowledgment**: We will confirm receipt within **48 hours**.  
   - **Investigation**: Our team will analyze and validate the report.  
   - **Resolution**: If confirmed, we will implement a fix and release an update.  
   - **Advisory**: Security advisories will be published if necessary.  

## Security Best Practices

To maintain the security of **Links**, users and developers should follow these best practices:

### Deployment Security
- **Use a secure hosting provider** (e.g., Vercel) with proper authentication and access control.  
- **Enforce HTTPS** to prevent data interception and ensure secure communication.  
- **Restrict API access** and avoid exposing sensitive endpoints publicly.  

### Application Security
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Run `npm audit` and update packages regularly.  
- **Use environment variables** to store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials).  
- **Validate user input** to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).  

### Development Security
- **Follow secure coding practices** and conduct code reviews.  
- **Enable security headers** such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options.  
- **Monitor for vulnerabilities** using tools like Dependabot or Snyk.
